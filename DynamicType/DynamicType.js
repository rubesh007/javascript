/* Dynamic Type */

//There isn't a specific "Dynamic type" in JavaScript. However, JavaScript itself is a dynamically typed language.
// JavaScript has dynamic data types meaning that type checking is done at runtime rather than compile time.
// With dynamically typed languages, a variable of the same name can be used to hold different data types.

let name = 'rubesh';
name = 'santhosh';
console.log( typeof name ); //string

name = 43;
console.log( typeof name ); // number
